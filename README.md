Predicting Airplane Delays: A Machine Learning Approach
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies flight delays caused by weather conditions. This involves:

Processing and preparing datasets extracted from ZIP files.
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and trends.
Building a baseline machine learning model and iteratively improving its performance.
Business Context
You are working for a travel booking platform focused on enhancing the customer experience for delayed flights. The company aims to implement a feature that informs travelers in advance if their flight is likely to be delayed due to weather conditions. This functionality will apply to flights departing from or arriving at the busiest domestic airports in the United States.

To achieve this, you will leverage historical on-time performance data from major air carriers. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, you can predict whether a flight is expected to experience a weather-related delay, helping customers make more informed travel decisions.

Step 1: Defining the Problem and Setting Up the Project
Business Problem & Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a flight will be delayed due to weather conditions at the time of booking. By integrating this predictive capability into a travel booking platform, customers can make more informed decisions when choosing their flights. This solution aims to enhance the customer experience by providing proactive notifications about potential delays, particularly for flights departing from or arriving at the busiest domestic airports in the United States.

Why Machine Learning?
Machine learning is an ideal solution for this problem because it allows us to identify patterns in historical flight performance data and forecast future delays based on various factors, such as:

Weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.)
Flight schedule (departure time, airline, airport, etc.)
Seasonal variations in delays
By analyzing past data, an ML model can detect complex relationships between these factors and predict whether a flight is likely to experience a delay.

Success Metrics
To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we will measure:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision & Recall: To balance false positives and false negatives.
F1-score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall to assess model performance.
Target Goal: Achieving at least 80% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Machine Learning Problem Type
This is a binary classification problem within supervised learning, where the model will classify flights as either:
‚úÖ "On Time"
‚ùå "Delayed" (due to weather conditions)

Project Setup
With the problem defined, the next steps involve:

Collecting and preprocessing data from historical flight records.
Exploring the data to identify trends and patterns.
Building a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
Evaluating and optimizing the model to achieve the best performance.
Deploying the model to provide real-time delay predictions for customers during booking.
This setup ensures a structured approach to solving the problem while aligning with business goals and customer needs. üöÄ
